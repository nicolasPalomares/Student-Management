# Java Spring Web Application for Educational Institution Management

PRECONDITION: If the user wants to execute the program, it is necessary to configure the database first. For this, I exported an SQL file
with all the tables and data originally created from my PostgreSQL software. That file is located inside "psql_database_backup" folder inside the project directory.
Load it inside any SQL database software, and then complete the "application.properties" file with your database credentials.

## Managed Elements
